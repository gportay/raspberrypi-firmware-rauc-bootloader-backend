# raspberrypi-firmware-rauc-bootloader-backend

An implementation of a RAUC custom bootloader backend for the Raspberry Pi
firmware.

## DESCRIPTION

The Raspberry Pi firmware supports fail-safe OS updates with A/B booting thanks
to the optional configuration file [autoboot.txt] and the one-shot reboot flag
[tryboot].

Unlike the [U-Boot] and [Barebox] bootloader backends, the custom bootloader
backend for the Raspberry Pi firmware cannot implement a boot-attempts counter.
Its one-shot reboot flag is very similar to the EFI variable `BootNext` of the
[EFI] bootloader backend. It is like an implementation `boot-attempts` counter
of 1 after an update.

_Important_: The firmware cannot fallback to the other slot if the primary slot
gets unbootable for some reason.

The Raspberry Pi firmware RAUC custom bootloader backend parses and updates the
file `autoboot.txt` in the first partition. It gets the one-shot reboot flag
set by the firmware to the device-tree blob node `/chosen/bootloader/partition`
at boot thanks to the utility `fdtget`, or it sets it down to the firmware for
the next boot thanks to the utility [vcmailbox].

It implements the four mandatory actions:
 - get the primary slot
 - set the primary slot
 - get the boot state
 - set the boot state

And it implements the optional action: get the current booted slot.

_Note_: The custom bootloader backend APIs for the Raspberry Pi firmware are
self-documented in the shell [backend] script.

## TRYBOOT

The online documentation for [tryboot] tells to set the one-shot flag in the
`reboot` command as below:

	# Quotes are important. Reboot only accepts a single argument.
	sudo reboot '0 tryboot'

The kernel of the [Raspberry Pi hardwares] forwards the optional [reboot]
argument given to [reboot(2)] to the [raspberrypi firmware driver] before the
system is restarted. The driver submits the mailbox tag to the VPU firmware
through the [mailbox property interface].

It is highly undesirable to trigger a `reboot` from within RAUC to set the new
boot state. The firmware utility [vcmailbox] submits from the userspace thanks
to the [broadcom vcio driver] instead.

_Note_: The tag **Set Reboot Flags** is undocumented; The [commit] in the linux
kernel tree reveals it as:

```

## CONFIGURATION FILES

### SYSTEM.CONF

The RAUC file [system.conf] **MUST** set the attribute `bootloader` to `custom`
in the section `system`, **AND** the attribute `bootloader-custom-backend` to
the location of the custom bootloader backend in the section `handlers`.

For example; if the backend is at `/usr/lib/rauc/backend/raspberrypi-firmware`:

	[system]
	# (...)
	bootloader=custom
	
	[handlers]
	# (...)
	bootloader-custom-backend=/usr/lib/rauc/backend/raspberrypi-firmware

Furthermore, the file **MUST** define the rootfs slots **AND** their firmware
slots in multiple sections `slot`; the firmware slots have to be bounded to
their rootfs slots using the attribute `parent` instead of having the attribute
`bootname` set.

For example; if the partition table is MBR, with the first partition containing
the [autoboot.txt] file, with the next two following partitions containing the
firmware files, and with the fourth and last partition is an extended partition
containings the two rootfs partitions:

	[slot.firmware.0]
	device=/dev/mmcblk0p2
	type=vfat
	parent=rootfs.0
	
	[slot.firmware.1]
	device=/dev/mmcblk0p3
	type=vfat
	parent=rootfs.1
	
	[slot.rootfs.0]
	device=/dev/mmcblk0p5
	type=ext4
	bootname=ROOTFS-A
	
	[slot.rootfs.1]
	device=/dev/mmcblk0p6
	type=ext4
	bootname=ROOTFS-B

### AUTOBOOT.TXT

The Raspberry Pi firmware file [autoboot.txt] **MUST** be located at path
`/boot/autoboot.txt`; i.e. the partition containing that file has to be mounted
to `/boot`.

For example; if booting from SD-card and using [fstab(5)]:

	# <device>      <mount point>  <type> <options> <dump>  <pass>
	/dev/mmcblk0p1  /boot          vfat   rw        0       0

### IMPORTANT

The firmware block devices **MUST** be coherent in both files [system.conf] and
[autoboot.txt]; i.e. the firmware partition numbers in `boot_partition` have to
match the ones defined in the slot sections.

For example; if the primary slot is `slot.rootfs.0`, and if the partition table
in the one defined in the [example](#systemconf) above:

	[all]
	tryboot_a_b=1
	boot_partition=2
	[tryboot]
	boot_partition=3

## REQUIREMENTS

### BASH

The [Bourne Again shell] since the custom bootloader backend is a shell script
using several bashism (such as `bash` arrays, the compound command `[[`, or the
binary operator `=~`).

_Important_: The [backend] is written in pure [bash(1)].

### FDTGET

The device-tree compiler [fdtget] utility to read the bootloader values from
the device-tree.

### VCMAILBOX

The Raspberry Pi [vcmailbox] utility to set the one-shot reboot flag [tryboot].

### VCIO DRIVER

The downstream Raspberry Pi [broadcom vcio driver] to let the [vcmailbox]
utility to drive the mailbox interface to VideoCore.

_Important_: The driver is not supported upstream.

## KERNEL UPDATES

The kernel updates through the installation of the firmware slots require an
installation [hook] in the bundle to include the appropriate kernel parameter
`root=` in the file `cmdline.txt`. More information are given in that [change].

_Note_: The kernel updates are doable using installation [handlers] in the root
filesystem as well.

## NATIVE BOOTCHOOSER IMPLEMENTATION

The native bootchooser implementation in the RAUC tree is on its way.

## EXAMPLE

The three files [system.conf-pi4], [autoboot.txt-a] and [hooks.bash] in the
directory `support` provide an example of a RAUC Raspberry Pi 4 Model B.

	install -D -m0644 support/system.conf-pi4 /etc/rauc/system.conf
	install -D -m0644 support/autoboot.txt-a /boot/autoboot.txt

_Note_: Set the following lines to the RAUC manifest file to enable for kernel
updates, and create the bundle then:

	[update]
	compatible=raspberrypi,4-model-b
	# (...)
	
	[hooks]
	filename=support/hook.bash
	
	[image.rootfs]
	# (...)
	hooks=pre-install
	
	[image.firmware]
	# (...)
	hooks=post-install
